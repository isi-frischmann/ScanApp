# Scan is an app where the user can check different grocery items for their price and if they are available in the Store.
We used the Walmart API, FireBase and CoreData.

First, you have to Scan a product to add it to your scanned List as you can see below:

Once you scan a product, it will automatically be added to your scanned list, where you can add it to your shopping cart.

You can, of course, add and delete items.

If you want to have more informations about the product just click the little info button and it'll
show you more details about the scaned and saved product. For example:
- If the product is in stock
- If the product is on sale 
- The current price
- Informations about the product
